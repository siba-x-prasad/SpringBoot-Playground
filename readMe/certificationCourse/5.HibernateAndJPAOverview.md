# Hibernate And JPA Overview
- What is Hibernate ?
- Benefits of Hibernate
- WHat is JPA
- Benefits of JPA
- Code Snippet
## Hibernate
- A framework for persisting/ saving Java Objects in Database.
- www.hibernate.org/orm
- Your Java Application <=> Hibernate <=> Database
## Benefits of Hibernate
- Hibernate handles all the low-level SQL
- Minimizes the amount of JDBC code you have to develop
- Hibernate provides the Object-to-Relational Mapping (ORM)

## Object to Relational Mapping (ORM)
  -  Java Class (Entity)
            ↓
    Hibernate ORM (JPA)
            ↓
    Database Table
## What is JPA?
- Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) ... previously known as Java Persistence API
- Standard API for Object-to-Relational-Mapping (ORM)
- Only a specification
- Defines a set of interfaces
- Requires an implementation to be usable
- Hibernate, EclipseLink are the implementations of JPA.
## What are Benefits of JPA
- By having a standard API, you are not locked to vendor's implementation
- Maintain portable, flexible code by coding to JPA spec (interfaces)
- Can theoretically switch vendor implementations
- For example, if Vendor ABC stops supporting their product
- You could switch to Vendor XYZ without vendor lock in
## Saving a Java Object with JPA
- Old days of JDBC ...
- you would have to manually write the SQL code
```
Student ("Paul", "Doe", "paul@luv2code.com" ) ;
// create Java object
Student theStudent = new
// save it to database
entityManager persist (theStudent) ;
```
- Special JPA helper object
- The data will be stored in the database SQL insert
## JPA Hibernate CRUD apps
- Create Objects
- Read Objects
- Update Objects
- Delete Objects
## Hibernate, JPA, JDBC
- Hibernate/ JPA uses JDBC for all database communication.
## MySQL Database
- In this course, we will use the MySQL Database
- MySQL includes two components
- MySQL Database Server
- MySQL Workbench
## MySQL Database Server
- The MySQL Database Server is the main engine of the database
- Stores data for the database
- Supports CRUD features on the data.
## MySQL Workbench
- MySQL Workbench is a client GUI for interacting with the database
- Create database schemas and tables
- Execute SQL queries to retrieve data
- Perform insert, updates and deletes on data
- Handle administrative functions such as creating users
- Others ...
## Install the MySQL software
- Step 1: Install MySQL Database Server
- https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysq1/
- Step 2: Install MySQL Workbench
- https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/
- In mac use command```brew install mysql```
- To Check status ```brew services list```
- To Check if MySql Installed or Not ```mysql --version```
## Two Database Scripts
- Folder: 00-starter-sql-scripts
- 01-create-user.sql
- 02-student-tracker.sql
## About: 01-create-user.sql
1. Create a new MySQL user for our application 
   - user id: springstudent 
   - password: springstudent mn

## Set up My SQL
- Start My Sql first
```
brew services start mysql
```
- To Stop MySql
```
brew services stop mysql
```
## Automatic Data Source Configuration
- In Spring Boot, Hibernate is the default implementation of JPA
- EntityManager is main component for creating queries etc...
- EntityManager is from Jakarta Persistence API JPA)
## Automatic Data Source Configuration
- Based on configs, Spring Boot will automatically create the beans: DataSource, EntityManager, ...
- You can then inject these into your app, for example your DAO
## Spring Boot - Auto configuration
- Spring Boot will automatically configure your data source for you
- Based on entries from Maven pom file
  - JDBC Driver: mysql-connector-j
  - Spring Data (ORM): spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
- DB connection info from application. properties
## application.properties
```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost: 3306/student_tracker 
spring.datasource.username=springstudent 
spring.datasource.password=springstudent
```
- No need to give JDBC driver class name.
- Spring Boot will automatically detect it based on URL.
## Creating Spring Boot - Command Line App
- We will create a Spring Boot - Command Line App.
- This will allow us to focus on Hibernate / JPA.
- Later in the course, we will apply this to a CRUD REST API.
## Create a Project
- Go to start.spring.io
- Add Dependencies
  - MySQL Driver
  - Spring Data JPA
