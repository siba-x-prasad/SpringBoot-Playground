# Spring Core
# 🔄 Inversion of Control (IoC) in Spring
- Inversion of Control (IoC) is a core concept in Spring that removes the responsibility of creating objects from the program itself and gives it to the Spring Container.
- Instead of the class creating its own dependencies, Spring injects the required dependencies automatically.
##  🔹 Simple Explanation
- Imagine a Car class that needs an Engine:
- Without IoC (manual creation):
```
 public class Car {
  private Engine engine;

  public Car() {
  engine = new Engine(); // Car creates its own Engine
  }
  }
```  
- With IoC (Spring creates & injects dependencies):
```
public class Car {
  private Engine engine;

  public Car(Engine engine) { // Engine is injected
  this.engine = engine;
  }
  }
```  
- Spring creates the Engine object
- Spring injects it into Car
- Car doesn’t need to know how to create Engine
- This is called Dependency Injection, which is a form of IoC.
 ###  🔹 Benefits of IoC
- Loose Coupling	Classes depend on interfaces or injected objects, not concrete implementations
- Easier Testing	You can inject mock dependencies easily
- Reusability	Components are easier to reuse
- Maintainability	Spring manages object creation, wiring, and lifecycle
###  🔹 How Spring Implements IoC
- Bean Definition → Define your class as a Spring Bean
```
@Component
  public class Engine { }
  Dependency Injection → Spring injects the beans
  @Component
  public class Car {
  private Engine engine;
  @Autowired
  public Car(Engine engine) {
  this.engine = engine;
  }
  }
```  
- Spring Container → Handles object creation, wiring, and lifecycle
###  🔹 Summary
- IoC = “Let Spring Control the Objects”
- Spring creates objects and injects dependencies automatically
- Forms the foundation of Spring Core
- Enables loose coupling, testability, and easy maintenance
